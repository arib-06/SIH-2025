# Traverz Website Redesign

This project implements a cohesive website experience using modern_traverz_website.html as the design reference. All pages have been updated to match the reference design's layout, styles, navigation, and interactions.

## Changes Made

### Global Assets Created
- `assets/css/theme.css` - Consolidated theme CSS with CSS custom properties
- `assets/js/site.js` - Shared JavaScript functionality for all pages

### Updated Pages
All HTML files have been updated with:
- Consistent header with navigation and profile picture
- Unified footer with social links
- Responsive design for multiple breakpoints (360px, 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px)
- Accessibility improvements (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Font Awesome icons for consistency
- AOS animations for smooth interactions

### Navigation Structure
- **Home** → `cover.html`
- **Experiences** → `translate.html` (Translation features)
- **AI** → `AI.html` and `Ai.html` (AI assistant)
- **Emergency** → `sos.html` (Emergency services)
- **Settings** → `setting.html` (Accessible via profile picture click)

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Consistent Theming**: CSS variables for colors, fonts, and spacing
2. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint optimization
3. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
4. **Profile Navigation**: Clicking profile picture opens settings.html
5. **Mobile Navigation**: Hamburger menu for mobile devices
6. **Smooth Animations**: AOS integration with reduced motion support
7. **Asset Optimization**: Consistent use of logo.png and final_logo.jpg
